    """
    Saves a CSV report of incomplete or invalid rows for a given client dataset.

    This function is typically called after global quality checks have flagged
    rows with missing or problematic data (e.g., missing clock-in/out, pay info, etc.).
    It saves the report to the appropriate `report/incomplete_rows/` folder inside
    the clientâ€™s directory.

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing only the incomplete or flagged rows.
        client_name (str): Name of the client folder (within /data).
        filename (str): Base name of the dataset (without extension).

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the target folder for saving the report does not exist.
